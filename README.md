# Gin Shop Project
Shop Api In one File :D(i know this is stupid...but maybe i will update it later)

## descriptiong
In this project i wrote the api of everything that a simple store website needs in a completely non-standard way (for now)with their methods like Post Get Push Delete. for example:
- authentication(login, register, logout, view, view as id)
- products(create, update, delete, view, view as id)
- cart(add, view)

The technologies used are:
- Gin-gonic
- Gorm
